## Subject

Build a currency conversion service.

Example input:
```json
{
	"base_currency": "USD",
	"value": 1000,
	"quote_currency": "EUR"
}
```

The server should return the converted number.

Requirements:
* Find an API that gives you the current exchange rate
* Use node.js
* Feel free to use as many libraries as you want

Bonus points:
* deploy it somewhere
* the simplest UI for it
* historical rates
